            <h2>Cardboard Controller</h2>
            <h3>Materiality & Form: Modeling a console Controller</h3>
            <p>
              This project serves as a deep dive into form-finding and the
              structural potential of corrugated cardboard. The objective was to
              replicate the iconic, highly ergonomic geometry of a gaming
              console controller—a shape defined by its seamless blends and
              complex compound curves—using only flat, rigid sheets of material.
              The process involved breaking down the controller's anatomy into a
              series of structural ribs and skins. To achieve the signature
              "horns" and curved grips, I employed radial scoring to create
              precise, parallel incisions that allow the cardboard to bend
              smoothly without buckling. Internal structural layers formed a
              skeleton that maintains shell integrity while handling the
              pressure of a human grip, while careful attention to the paper's
              natural grain enabled organic transitions between the buttons and
              chassis. Beyond the aesthetic challenge, the project explored
              cardboard as a prototyping medium for product design. It
              demonstrates that before moving to 3D printing or clay modeling,
              cardboard provides a tactile, immediate way to test scale, button
              placement, and hand feel. This study highlights the intersection
              of manual craftsmanship and industrial design, proving that
              complex ergonomics can be effectively analyzed through accessible,
              hands-on material exploration.
