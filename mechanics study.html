            <h2>Motion Conversion Study</h2>
            <h3>
              Translating Motion: A Study in Digital Fabrication and Mechanics
            </h3>
            <p>
              The core objective of this project was to master the transition
              from a digital 3D model to a high-functioning physical mechanism.
              The challenge centered on the classic mechanical problem of
              converting circular motion into linear motion, requiring strict
              adherence to tolerances and material properties. The assembly
              features a hybrid construction approach combining 3D-printed
              components with laser-cut framework. Complex geometries including
              a custom-pitched drive gear and guided slider block were printed
              in PLA for dimensional stability, while the chassis and support
              pillars were cut from 6mm acrylic to provide a rigid, transparent
              housing that allows the internal mechanics to be clearly observed.
              The entire mechanism was designed in Fusion 360, requiring careful
              calculation of gear ratios and interference fits to ensure smooth
              movement without excessive friction. Through several prototype
              iterations, I addressed common mechanical issues such as backlash
              and binding. The final result is a pedagogical tool that clearly
              demonstrates kinematic principles while showcasing a professional
              workflow from initial CAD sketching and stress simulation to final
              assembly and testing. This project highlights the ability to
              select appropriate fabrication methods and manage the interplay
              between different manufactured parts within a single functional
              system.
