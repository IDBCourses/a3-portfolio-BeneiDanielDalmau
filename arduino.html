            <h1>Arduino Creature</h1>
            <h3>An Interactive Robotic Companion</h3>
            <p>
              This project centers on creating a small autonomous creature using
              Arduino as its brain. The creature uses a combination of
              sensors—including ultrasonic distance sensors, light sensors, and
              a tilt sensor—to perceive its surroundings and respond
              accordingly. Based on environmental inputs, it exhibits behaviors
              like moving toward light sources, retreating from obstacles, and
              emitting sounds or LED patterns that reflect its "mood." The
              physical build incorporates servo motors for movement, giving the
              creature the ability to scuttle, turn, or adjust its posture. The
              body was constructed from lightweight materials including
              cardboard and 3D-printed parts, keeping the design accessible and
              modifiable. The creature's personality emerges from the programmed
              logic: it becomes "curious" when detecting movement, "calm" in
              stable conditions, and "startled" by sudden changes. This project
              served as an exploration of physical computing fundamentals,
              including circuit design, sensor integration, and behavioral
              programming. It demonstrates how simple components can combine to
              create surprisingly lifelike interactions, bridging the gap
              between digital code and physical expression. The modular nature
              of the design allows for future iterations with additional sensors
              or more complex behaviors.
